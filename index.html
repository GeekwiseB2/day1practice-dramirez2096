    <h1>My Bitwise Story</h1>
    <p>I initially heard of Bitwise on the news. Like most people, I didn't think much of it at first because I honestly did not think it was going to last long (I mean come on it's Fresno, the only thing that lasts long here is triple digit heat). It wasn't until recently that I've really seen that Bitwise is truly a force to be reckoned with. A few months ago, my boss told me that Bitwise was hosting a walkthrough for the Fresno County Office of Education and she asked me if I wanted to go with her since she knew I'm a huge tech guy (and a huge nerd). I attended the walkthrough and realized that this was something that I wanted to be a part of. I am 100% glad that I decided to take classes here and I cannot wait to see what the future holds and what opportunities are waiting for me at Bitwise and in this industry. </p>
